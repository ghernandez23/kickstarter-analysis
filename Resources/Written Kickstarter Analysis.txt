# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
This project will analyze the outcome for theater kickstarter campaigns based on their
launch date as well as their campaign goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to show why the campaigns were either successful, failed, or cancelled
based on the data provided. We will also look for any trends in the data that prove campaigns were more successful
during certain periods of the year, as well as if their fundraising goal had anything to with their success/failure.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date- Based on the data provided, we can see that campaigns lauched 
throughout the entire year have at least a 50% success rate with May-July showing both the largest amount of 
successful campaigns as well as the highest percentage of success overall for theater campaigns. The data shows 
that overall, successful campaigns tend to out number failed campaigns for every month of the year. Failed 
campaigns are pretty consistently around 30-40% of the outcomes for any given month as well. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals- After further analysis of the data, we can come to the conclusion that
85% of the total number of kickstarters have a goal of less than 9,999$ total, and only 15% of the remaning 
campaigns have a higher goal. If a campaign has a goal of less than 4,999$, we can see that they have the highest 
percentage (72-76%) of being successful. Overall, in most categorys of goals successful campaigns tend to outweigh
the failures, with virtually zero play kickstarters being cancelled.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered- This was my first time combing through so much data at once as well 
working with formulas in excel and this was the biggest challenge for me by far. With consistency and a thorough
review of the information in Module one I was able to overcome any difficulties and now I feel completly comfortable
with both analyzing large amounts of data as well as visualizing the reults via graphs/charts. 

## Results

- "What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?-I can say without a doubt that
campaigns lauched in quarter 2 of the year have the highest chance of being successful and that overall an average
of over 60% of total campaigns will be successful.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?- I can conclude that if a campaign has a goal of less 
than 5K you have a very high chance of being successful in funding your kickstarter. Most of the data suggests
that if you have a goal of 15,000-39,000 your chance of failure if 50% or higher. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?- The data does an excellent job of painting a picture of small budget
campaigns which means that the data on kickstarter campaigns with a goal of over 20,000 is very limited, as it 
makes up only 5% total of the dataset.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?- With what we are trying to visualize I 
think bar charts would be a great way to show success/failed percentages as well as a stacked bar graph to show
comparisions in kickstarter success/failures by month.
