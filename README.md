# kickstarter-analysis
Analysis of kickstarter data with the purpose of uncovering trends 
## Overview of Project
This project will analyze the outcome for theater kickstarter campaigns based on their
launch date as well as their campaign goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to show why the campaigns were either successful, failed, or cancelled
based on the data provided. We will also look for any trends in the data that prove campaigns were more successful
during certain periods of the year, as well as if their fundraising goal had anything to with their success/failure
