# Kickstarter-Analysis
  Analysis of kickstarter data with the purpose of uncovering trends 
## Overview of Project
  This project will analyze the outcome for theater kickstarter campaigns based on their
launch date as well as their campaign goals.

## Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis is to show why the campaigns were either successful, failed, or cancelled
based on the data provided. We will also look for any trends in the data that prove campaigns were more successful
during certain periods of the year, as well as if their fundraising goal had anything to with their success/failure
## Analysis and Challenges

  Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date- Based on the data provided, we can see that campaigns lauched 
throughout the entire year have at least a 50% success rate with May-July showing both the largest amount of 
successful campaigns as well as the highest percentage of success overall for theater campaigns. The data shows 
that overall, successful campaigns tend to out number failed campaigns for every month of the year. Failed 
campaigns are pretty consistently around 30-40% of the outcomes for any given month as well. 

  Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals- After further analysis of the data, we can come to the conclusion that
85% of the total number of kickstarters have a goal of less than 9,999$ total, and only 15% of the remaning 
campaigns have a higher goal. If a campaign has a goal of less than 4,999$, we can see that they have the highest 
percentage (72-76%) of being successful. Overall, in most categorys of goals successful campaigns tend to outweigh
the failures, with virtually zero play kickstarters being cancelled.

  Challenges and Difficulties Encountered- This was my first time combing through so much data at once as well 
working with formulas in excel and this was the biggest challenge for me by far. Specifically, the portion of
the outcomes based on goals section where I was having to set the range of successful campaigns between 
1,000 and 4,999. writing majority of the function was easy with going through the information in the module, 
however I couldnt figure out where in the formula you ended the range. with some practice, I was finally able to 
get it and repreat the process with the rest of the data. 

## Results

  Afer a thorough review of the theater kickstarter campaigns, the data suggests that overall campaigns have 
a better chance of succeeding with 61% of all theater campaigns hitting their target goals of raising money. We 
can also see that majority of the volume of different theater kickstarter campaigns took place in the second quarter
of the year, suggesting that the Spring would be the ideal time to set out on achieving your goals of funding. 
When reviewing the data of plays specifically, the data suggests that the best possibility for a successful campaign 
would require the play to have a funding goal of less than 5,000. Campaigns have a 74% success rate with chances of 
success dwindling the higher the goal is. Majority of the data on theater plays is made of up of campaigns with a 
goal of 5,000 or less (69%) so I would say this is a major limitation of the data that was presented. while trying 
to visualize this data I believe basic line graphs are the best way to help with understanding all of the trends 
within the data.
